Some explanations...
- homework1 (box blur): 
   - I've written this code to work with how .ppm files are stored in ASCII format;
   - changing the box blur size can be done from the top of the *blur.cpp* code;
   - getting the absolute difference can be done using the *getAbsDiff.cpp* file;
   - as an example, I've also included a source image, *intel.ppm*, the two blurred photos that result from it (3x3 and 5x5 box blur), and the absolute difference of the two blurs (hope I understood right what you guys meant by "absolute difference").
- homework2 (mesh/jpeg encoder): 
   - I really couldn't figure out this one, I've done some research on it but I barely found anything on how to work with meshes. 
- homwork3 (video to frames): 
   - pretty straight forward, all good.
